# Pascal_prg
An old programming course in Pascal. It all took place before I discovered the use of github and It's been mostly rotting on my hard drive for all these years (since like 2016).   
I've celaned it up a bit by deleteing executibles and all the files generated by freepascal...   
This was all created using freepascal (fp) on linux.
