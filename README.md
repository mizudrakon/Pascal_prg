# Pascal_prg
An old programming course in Pascal. It all took place before I discovered the use of github and It's been mostly rotting on my hard drive for all these years (since like 2016).   
I've celaned it up a bit by deleteing executibles and all the files generated by freepascal...   
This was all created using freepascal (fp) on linux.
Most of these are homeworks, the GameofLife contains my semester project: my first imlementation of Conway's Game of Life. At the moment it's a bit of a mess, since there were some issues with uploading it to the school system, and I just moved on after that.   
I guess you can get an idea what sort of pascal coding I can do if I ever tried to refresh it in like a week or so...
