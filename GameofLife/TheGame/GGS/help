Glorified Glider Simulator user manual:
* Write 's' or 'S' to stop the program (mark the end of pattern input in part 3.) - this is also the only formal way how to stop the program.
* Write 'help' to see this document again.

1. Specify first row and column of your pattern input:
   row: integer in specified range (1-max)		i.e.:	row:1
   column: integer in specified range (1-max)			column:1

2. Pattern input:
  0  			dead cell
  x,X,n,N		no change
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 	live cell (number of generation cell can survive on its own)
  i,I			immortal cell
  e,E			mark the end of row
  s,S,q,Q		mark the end of pattern (and press ENTER)
  every other symbol is meaningless

	i.e.:	01e			0i0ie
		001e			00ie
		111s 			iiiiis
	to make a glider :)		to make Immortan Joe

3. Do you wish to insert another pattern? * 'y' lets you do it (calls 1.)
					  * 'n'	continues to 4.

4. Number of generations:* integer (1-512)
			 * or 's' ('S' or just 'stop' to stop the program)
			 * 'insert' will let you add another pattern to the existing one
			  (calls 1.)

5. How many symbols fit on your screen?
	* if the relevant part of the playfield gets too large, you can choose to divide it into multiple parts that will be written out succesively. It is strongy recommanded to avoid this and set max on the second line of game.pas to already fitting number.

Have fun!
